    "text": "Setting up gander and ellmer\nThere are a few steps involved in setting up gander and ellmer to work with your preferred LLM (Large Language Model) service. The steps are as follows:\n\nInstall the gander and ellmer packages.\nGet your API Key, from say Anthropic, ChatGPT, or Ollama.\n\n\n\nAnthropic: visit https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys\nChatGPT: visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\nOllama: visit https://ollama.com/ # runs LLMs LOCALLY! NO API Key needed.\n\nSee “Choosing a model” in vignette(“gander”, package = “gander”) to learn more.\n\nSave the API_KEY of you preferred LLM service in your .Rprofile file. For example, if you are using Ollama, you would add the following line to your .Rprofile, as follows:\n\n\n## RUN THESE IN YOUR CONSOLE\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nlibrary(usethis)\nusethis::edit_r_profile()\n\nThis will open the .Rprofile file in your RStudio editor. You will need to add (one of ) the following lines to the file:\nOPENAI_API_KEY = “YOUR_API_KEY_HERE”\\ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = “YOUR_API_KEY_HERE” etc.\n\nAlso add one of these line to the .Rprofile file:\n\noptions(.gander_chat = ellmer::chat_anthropic())\n\nIf you wish to run models locally for free, you can use Ollama. In that case, you will need to:\n\n\ninstall the Ollama CLI https://ollama.com/download\ndownload a model from https://ollama.com/models, say “llama3.1”\nthen add the following line to your .Rprofile file: options(.gander_chat = ellmer::chat_ollama(model = \"llama3.1\"))\nMacOS: Ensure you start ollama server by running ollama serve in your terminal.\nWindows: Add ollama.exe to your startup programs\n\n\nSetup the gander assistant: The gander assistant is interfaced with the via the gander addin. For easiest access, we recommend registering the gander addin to a keyboard shortcut.\n\nIn RStudio, navigate to Tools &gt; Modify Keyboard Shortcuts &gt; Search \"gander\". The package author suggests Ctrl+Alt+G (or Ctrl+Cmd+G on macOS).\n\nRestart RStudio to ensure the changes take effect."
